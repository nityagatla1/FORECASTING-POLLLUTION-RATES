# FORECASTING-POLLLUTION-RATES


This project delves into the analysis and forecasting of air pollution trends in the United States, particularly comparing the states of Florida and Illinois. Air pollution, driven by emissions from vehicles, industrial processes, and other sources, has severe consequences for both human health and the environment. In this project, we leverage statistical and machine learning techniques to model air quality data and predict future pollution trends.

Our approach involves evaluating various forecasting models, including time series and regression-based techniques, to determine the most accurate model for predicting air quality over the next four years. By considering model fit, accuracy, and statistical evaluation, we ensure the reliability of our forecasts. The insights gained can help inform public policy and guide efforts to mitigate the harmful effects of air pollution in the future.
